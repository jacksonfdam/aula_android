If you don't already have one you can easily install a WAMP or LAMP server. If you are running windows you will want a wamp server. You can get this from http://www.wampserver.com/en/ it's a straight forward install and is well documented.

If you are running Linux you can install a LAMP stack, this differs slightly per distro.
